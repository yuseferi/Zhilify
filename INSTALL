                     SETUP: How to install Zhilify ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use Zhilify you have to put it on your (development) server, and
include it in your script. You can put it somewhere in the INCLUDE_PATH, or 
specify the full path to the "class.zhilify.php" file.

Next you'll need to rename zhilify.sample.ini to zhilify.ini, and make any
setting changes. The zhilify.ini is optional, Zhilify will use "sane" defaults
if no zhilify.ini is found, or the item is commented out.
